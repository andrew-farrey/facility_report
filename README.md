Facility-level data quality report for the NSSP ESSENCE public health surveillance platform.

Currently configured for Kentucky. The theme can be changed to other .Rmd supported bootswatch themes (or one could use CSS).

To do:
- remove references to Kentucky entities
- source a national facility list (that can be continually updated, preferably?)
