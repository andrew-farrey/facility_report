Facility-level data quality report for the NSSP ESSENCE public health surveillance platform.

Currently, there are a few references to Kentucky entities and Kentucky facilities are listed as parameter choices. In future, I will scale this to the national level.

I picked the "readable" bootswatch theme, but this can be changed to any other bootswatch v3 free theme supported by Rmarkdown (or one could use custom CSS).
